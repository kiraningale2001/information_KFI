It prefers annual rainfall of around 800ml, with temperature hovering around 80 degree Fahrenheit, never falling below 39.

Its branches are spread very wide and high, and on the ends of those you will find pinnate, dark green leaflets.

                This tree is utilized for its shade, as it is one of the only shade giving trees that is able to grow in these harsh regions.
